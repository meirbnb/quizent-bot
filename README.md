This is a telegram bot programmed in Java. It helps school
students prepare for their UNT (EHT) testing by providing various tests of several subjects. By this
bot, students will be able to pass quizzes and receive their results and overall progress. I decided
to make this project because students struggle to find relevant questions and also teachers asked me
to make such a tool where it will be convenient for both instructors as well as students. Hence, students 
will buy subscriptions using our bot and will get the opportunity to use this bot with thousands of UNT (EHT) questions.
